                These Terms and Conditions, including all transactions, interactions, and activities carried out on the YOBHA Website or through its products and services, shall be governed by, interpreted, and enforced in accordance with the laws of India, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles that may provide for the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. By accessing or using the Website, creating an account, or making a purchase, you expressly agree to comply with all applicable Indian laws, regulations, and rules, including but not limited to the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, the Information Technology Act, 2000, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regulations, and any other relevant statutes governing e-commerce, online transactions, retail sales, and consumer rights.

                Any disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or in connection with these Terms, your use of the Website, or any purchase of products or services from YOBHA (collectively, "Disputes") shall first be attempted to be resolved amicably through good faith negotiation. Either party may initiate such negotiations by providing written notice to the other party, specifying the nature of the dispute, the relief sought, and any relevant supporting information. Both parties agree to use their best efforts to resolve disputes promptly and in good faith.

              <p className="text-text-medium text-sm md:text-base leading-relaxed">
                Nothing in this clause shall prevent YOBHA from seeking interim, injunctive, or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, as may be necessary to protect its intellectual property rights, confidential information, or prevent unauthorized access to or use of its Website, products, or services.
